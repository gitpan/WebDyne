**** INTRODUCTION ****

WebDyne is a dynamic content generation engine for Apache/mod_perl and
FastCGI capable web servers.  HTML documents with embedded Perl code are
processed to produce customised HTML output.

An installer is included in the base WebDyne module for Apache, other
installers are available by downloading the appropriate module (e.g. 
WebDyne::Install::Lighttpd) from CPAN.

Once WebDyne is installed any file with a .psp extension is treated as a
WebDyne source file.  It is parsed for WebDyne specific tags (such as <perl>
and <block>) which are interpreted and executed on the server as
appropriate.  The resulting output is then sent to the browser.

Once parsed paged are are optionally stored in a partially compiled format,
speeding up subsequent processing.

The aim of WebDyne is to make coding web pages with Perl components a
faster, easier and more enjoyable experience.
