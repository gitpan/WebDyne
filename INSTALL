== INSTALLATION VIA CPAN =======================================================

You can install the base WebDyne module, and all prerequisites, with:

perl -MCPAN -e 'install WebDyne'

This assumes you have already setup and initialised CPAN appropriately for
your environment.

Note that WebDyne will not be automatically usable after this - you must
modify your Web server configuration to make it active.  You may do this
manually (referring to the documentation available in the doc directory, or
at http://webdyne.org) or via an installer module which will do the work for
you.

The base WebDyne module comes with an installer module for Apache. It will
be installed into whichever bin location (usually /usr/local/bin) your CPAN
configuration defaults to.

You can run the installer with the command:

wdapacheinit

It will use reasonable defaults to try and locate and update your Apache
config, Webdyne cache dir.  etc.  If you need to alter the defaults do a

wdapacheinit --help

Other installer modules are available for FastCGI server such as Lighttpd.
If you wish to download an installer module - which will add Webdyne hooks
into your Web server - download the WebDyne::Install module appropriate for
your server type, e.g:

perl -MCPAN -e 'install WebDyne::Install::Lighttpd'

You may then run the installer script, e.g.:

wdlighttpdinit

The actual location of the installer script will be distribution dependent -
you may have to search for it after module installation.

The following installer modules and their installation scripts are currently
available:

WebDyne::Install::Lighttpd      bin/wdlighttpdinit 


== INSTALLATION VIA MANUAL BUILD ===============================================

You can download and install the base WebDyne module with the following commands
after it is unpacked:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

You will need to download and install all prerequisite modules manually. Modules
required should be listed when you run the "perl Makefile.PL" command above.

Similarly to the CPAN install you will either need to adjust your Web server
config manually to serve WebDyne pages, or run/download the appropriate
installer module.
